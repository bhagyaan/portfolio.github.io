    <p>In 2008, Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah co-created the restaurant-finding app Zomato. 
        It has developed over time into a full-fledged platform for both meal delivery and
         eating out, and now serves millions of people all over the world. The website started 
         as a restaurant-listing-and-recommendation portal.They renamed the company Zomato in
          2010 as they were unsure if they would "just stick to food" and also to avoid a potential 
          naming conflict In January 2015, Zomato acquired Seattle-based restaurant discovery 
          portal Urbanspoon, which led to the firm's entry into the United States and Australia.
         This U.S. expansion brought Zomato into direct competition with similar models such as Yelp 
         and Foursquare</p>
